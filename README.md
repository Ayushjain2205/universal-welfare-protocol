# 🌐 Universal Welfare Protocol

## 🎯 Project Description

In our quest to create an impactful solution for the majority of Indians, especially those who earn between 12.5k to 50k rupees or below, we unearthed some pressing challenges they face:

- 🚫 **Lack of visibility** of government schemes.
- 📑 **Unorganised structure**: Varied schemes (like food, health, finance, etc.) have different formats, often requiring separate cards and documentation.
- 💸 **Corruption**: Many deserving beneficiaries don't receive the benefits due to corruption.

Our solution is the **Universal Welfare Protocol**, aiming to simplify access to government and CSR benefits and ensuring transparency:

🔑 **Universal ID**: A unique wallet for each citizen.
📜 **Profile Creation**: Input details like salary, government ID, photo verification.
✅ **Card Verification**: Get your official Universal Welfare card.
🔍 **Explore Schemes**: Find out the various benefits you're eligible for.
🌐 **Opt-in Easily**: Choose the schemes suitable for you.
📲 **Scan & Verify**: Make it work, online or offline.

While our primary target is the lower-to-middle income bracket, this ID system is versatile, catering to students and the general populace. The idea is simple: many are eligible for various schemes but are unaware. With the **Universal Welfare Protocol**, they will be informed and empowered.

Given that half of India is online, we aim to harness this connectivity to make lives better. 😊

## 🛠️ How It's Made

Our solution is a mobile web app built with **Next.js**, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. **Universal Welfare protocol** is a multi-chain system, so benefits aren't bound by the confines of a single chain.

Key Features:

- 🌌 **Multi-chain Protocol**: Benefits flow seamlessly across chains.
- 🔐 **Biometric-Powered Wallets**: Using Cometh connect, we've made the wallet creation process straightforward, discarding the need to remember seed phrases.
- 📝 **Solidity Smart Contracts**: Powers the Universal Welfare Card and Schemes across multiple blockchains.

What sets us apart is the UX. We understand the importance of usability. Thus, our interface is not only gasless but also intuitively designed for simplicity. After all, for our target audience, simplicity is the key to adoption. 🚀
